This project was made to benchmark and record results for a scholarly letter targetted to IEEE. The project specifically targets ESP32 IoT microcontroller along with any other flashed microcontroller that uses Micropython.

The project contains 10 combinations of ciphers and communication protocols for evaluation and benchmarking purposes. There are 5 ciphers by 2 communication protocols:

The 5 ciphers are:

ASCON
PRESENT
SIMON
SPECK
CHACHA20

and the communication protocols are:
